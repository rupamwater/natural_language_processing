### Natural Language Processing project

This project lists the models build to perform the following using Recurrant Neural Network models

1. Text Generation from the language style learned from existing poem and generated using |Sequence to sequence model
2. Translation from French to English using Sequence to Sequence Model
3. Translation from French to English using Sequence to Sequence model with Attention


### Model Components

These models were build using keras library in tensorflow with the combination of Embedding layer, LSTM layer and dense layers. The description of respective models are as follows,

1. Text Generation
2. Translation
3. Translation using attention model
